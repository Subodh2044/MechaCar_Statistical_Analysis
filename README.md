Since, the linear regressiona vehicle length and ground clearance have p-value that is less than 0.05, offered a non-random varaince to values in mpg whereas vehicle weight spoiler angle and AWD has a p-value that is greater than 0.05, which is a random amount of variance to mpg values. Since the intercepts and linear regresssion coffricients are non-zero, linear model's slope is also non-zero. The R square has a value of 0.71 which is not significant enough to provide confidence in independent variables. R square of greater than 0.75 would require in order for the effective prediction.

The design specification of suspension could indicates that the variance of the coils should not exceed 100 PSI, which the current data from manufacturing meets in all the lots as the variance is 62 PSI whereas design from Lot1 and Lot2 meets but not from Lot3 because it exceeds 100 PSI by 70.
