Since, the linear regressiona vehicle length and ground clearance have p-value that is less than 0.05, offered a non-random varaince to values in mpg whereas vehicle weight spoiler angle and AWD has a p-value that is greater than 0.05, which is a random amount of variance to mpg values. Since the intercepts and linear regresssion coffricients are non-zero, linear model's slope is also non-zero. The R square has a value of 0.71 which is not significant enough to provide confidence in independent variables. R square of greater than 0.75 would require in order for the effective prediction.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specification of suspension could indicates that the variance of the coils should not exceed 100 PSI, which the current data from manufacturing meets in all the lots as the variance is 62 PSI whereas design from Lot1 and Lot2 meets but not from Lot3 because it exceeds 100 PSI by 70.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

# Description

To provide the clear outcome of the result hypothesis testing is performed. To test the veracity of the claim, one-tailed or two-tailed hypothesis is performed based on the population parameter. The two-tailed hypothesis is conducted to test if the mean of the sample is greater or less than the mean of the total population.

# Metrics

 The study is conducted by comparing the mean of MPG of MechaCar and Mtcars dataset to test if there is significant difference between the MPG for the vehicles in those two datasets.
 
 # Hypothesis
 
 Null Hypothesis (Ho): There is no signifincat difference in mean MPG between two datasets.
 
 Alternative Hypothese (Ha): There is signifincat difference in mean MPG between two datasets.
 
 # Statistical Testing
 
 We will conduct the study by perfgorming two-tailed hypothesis to test both greater or less than sides of the range of specified datasets i.e. MechaCar and Mtcars.
