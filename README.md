Since, the linear regressiona vehicle length and ground clearance have p-value that is less than 0.05, offered a non-random varaince to values in mpg whereas vehicle weight spoiler angle and AWD has a p-value that is greater than 0.05, which is a random amount of variance to mpg values. Since the intercepts and linear regresssion coffricients are non-zero, linear model's slope is also non-zero. The R square has a value of 0.71 which is not significant enough to provide confidence in independent variables. R square of greater than 0.75 would require in order for the effective prediction.
